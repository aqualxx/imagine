# Imagine

This project is about automatic disposable account creation for https://creator.nightcafe.studio

It also has features to complete tasks such as profile completion and liking published creations for extra credits.

# How to use:

- Install all required imported libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Just run imagine.py

# Running multiple at a time:

- You can run multiple at a time, just make sure not to minimize any, having them behind other windows or not as active window is fine as long as they're not minimized.
- Also, only start the next script once the email verification of the previous one has completed. (otherwise verifMail.txt will overwrite each other)
